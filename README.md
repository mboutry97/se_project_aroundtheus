# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images
- GitHub

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

This project made me focus on the layout of the blocks and elements using the grid layout for the first time. It also required the use of font-face and media queries so that the site would be optimized for different screen sizes. We imported some pictures in the form of .svg files as well so that their resolution remained good even if they were expanded or zoomed in on. This is optimal for icons.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
